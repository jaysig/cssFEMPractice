DEBUGGERS


COLORS
3:02:59 - 3:07:54
There are a variety of color formats in CSS include hexadecimal, RGB, RGBA, HSA, and HSLA.
The “A” in RGBA and HSLA stands fora “alpha” or transparency.
3:07:55 - 3:12:46
HSL stands fora hue, saturation, and luminosity. It’s a more intuitive way
to select and alter colors as opposed to hexadecimal.

3:12:47 - 3:16:11
Reducing an object’s opacity will make both the object and its children transparent.
It’s often better to use a background color with transparency so the children of the object aren’t affected.
Using RGBA or HSLA is often best fora shadows.
3:16:12 - 3:18:15
The appearance property in CSS allows developers to change the look of an element.
Currently, the appearance property requires vendor prefixes.

Do not just use color to deal with color blind people


FONTS AND TEXT shadows
The font-face rule declares a font family that can be used within a
CSS document. It’s important to know what font types are compatible in different browsers.

3:24:46 - 3:30:47:
Font licensing can be an issue with web fonts. Also, font files are large and can take a while to download.
Using a font service like Google Fonts will help with both of these issues.

3:30:48 - 3:35:26
Font Squirrel font-face generator will generate the font files needed fora
a webpage and optimize the files fora the smallest download size

TEXT SHADOW
3:35:27 - 3:38:19
The key to a good-looking shadow is transparency. Don’t use opaque shadows. The four settings fora a shadow are left,
top, blur and color.
3:38:20 - 3:39:52
Create better looking text-shadows by including multiple shadows. Multiple shadows can be added by
separating each text shadow with a comma.

3:39:53 - 3:45:24
Box shadows are similar in syntax to text-shadows, however, they add two additional values: inset and spread.
3:45:25 - 3:46:50
Estelle experiments with generated content and box-shadow.
3:46:51 - 3:49:35
Text stroke in CSS allows you to outline text. However, it currently only works in webkit and can be re-created using text-shadow.

BACKGROUND SIZE
The background-clip property in CSS indicates which part of the background is showing.
Background origin indicates where you the background image begins. When considering hiDPI images,
the background-size property determines how backgrounds will grow or shrink.

BORDER IMAGE
Border images are use a 9-slice scaling technique where the images is “sliced”
into nine regions and the corners maintain their aspect ratio while the other regions shrink/grow.
